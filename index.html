        <div class="timeline">
          DECEMBER 6, 1881 Butler, Missouri first turns the lights on in its courthouse and for residents – a full nine months before Edison’s Pearl Street Station opens.
          AUGUST 1909 Electricity generated by the Theodore Roosevelt Dam begins transmission to residents of Phoenix and the Salt River Valley. The project was the first major project of the Bureau of Reclamation
           The project was the first major project of the Bureau of Reclamation
          1932 Franklin Roosevelt gives a campaign speech in Portland, Oregon, in which he promotes public power as a right of communities, and a ‘yardstick’ for holding all electric utilities accountable for good service and low rates.
           NOVEMBER 1965 A blackout affects over 30 million people in all of New York state, New Jersey, across New England, and parts of eastern Canada. The blackout spurs the formation of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and regional reliability councils
          1976 Half of the entities formed this year are Joint Action Agencies
          1977 Congress creates the Department of Energy, including the Western Area Power Administration
          NOVEMBER 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) is enacted, allowing independent suppliers to compete with utility-owned power generation.
          1999 FERC Order 2000 encourages the formation of Regional Transmission Organizations.The Energy Policy Act, the most significant energy law enacted in more than a decade, creates mandatory reliability standards, changes PURPA, repeals PUHCA, and gives FERC tools to prevent market manipulation.

        The Utility of the Future is a model for utilities of all sizes to achieve more efficient operations, enhanced productivity, and long-term sustainability. More than 120 utilities have been recognized since the launch of the program in 2016
        
        Ideas In Future
        A bottle that can generate, pure water, gas, ice cubes that can be changed from a button
        A water bottle that can be compacted and the size of it can change.
        A car that could generate pure water from electricity.
        We can  install a mini water fountain inside a car or any electric vehicle that can generate water from a click of a button
        Also we can install solar panels on the roof of the car and try to make them basically invisible so they can’t be seen so it will look better as an aesthetic and look nicely pleasing to look at 
        Another idea that I have is to create computers for people so the systems will run better instead of getting prebuilt. Sometimes the prebuilts hardware isn’t produced efficiently, and the hardware isn’t good at all. Most of the time prebuilts don’t last as long as building a fresh new computer.

        <h5 class="card-title" id="home">Utilities </h5>
         <p>Water and sewer:
 Water and sewage utilities includes everything from the water that comes out of your shower faucet, the water that allows you to flush your toilet, the water in your dishwasher and much more. Usage is measured by a meter and then reported to the public utilities commission. This utility bill is sent to the individual apartment or home, or to the apartment complex, where an apartment manager will split the bill evenly among tenants.
Trash and recycling:
This utility includes the removal of recycling, trash and organic waste. Apartment landlords usually have a contract with the city’s waste management company to collect tenants’ trash and recycling. Usually, this service comes with a small monthly fee.
Natural gas and electricity:
This utility includes light in your home, power for appliances and heat in the winter. Natural gas and electricity use a meter to measure the amount you use. Tenants are charged a cost based on an agreed-upon rate and usage. You will typically get this bill at the end of each month.
Internet, telephone and cable:
These utilities are not essential but are very common and can often be purchased from the same company. The cost of this utility can vary greatly depending on the type of service. You typically pay a monthly fee for each of these services.<p>

         Technology
For comforts like cable TV, internet, and phone service, contact your preferred service providers to connect your home. These are not essential services so you can decide which provider and service level you’d prefer. Buying  a modem and router instead of renting, and choosing streaming services instead of cable helps homeowners save on technology utilities.
