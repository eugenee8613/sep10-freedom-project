          DECEMBER 6, 1881 Butler, Missouri first turns the lights on in its courthouse and for residents – a full nine months before Edison’s Pearl Street Station opens.
          AUGUST 1909 Electricity generated by the Theodore Roosevelt Dam begins transmission to residents of Phoenix and the Salt River Valley. The project was the first major project of the Bureau of Reclamation
          1932 Franklin Roosevelt gives a campaign speech in Portland, Oregon, in which he promotes public power as a right of communities, and a ‘yardstick’ for holding all electric utilities accountable for good service and low rates.
          NOVEMBER 1965 A blackout affects over 30 million people in all of New York state, New Jersey, across New England, and parts of eastern Canada. The blackout spurs the formation of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and regional reliability councils
          1976 Half of the entities formed this year are Joint Action Agencies
          1977 Congress creates the Department of Energy, including the Western Area Power Administration
          NOVEMBER 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) is enacted, allowing independent suppliers to compete with utility-owned power generation.
          1999 FERC Order 2000 encourages the formation of Regional Transmission Organizations.The Energy Policy Act, the most significant energy law enacted in more than a decade, creates mandatory reliability standards, changes PURPA, repeals PUHCA, and gives FERC tools to prevent market manipulation.

          Future Inferences/Predictions
        The Utility of the Future is a model for utilities of all sizes to achieve more efficient operations, enhanced productivity, and long-term sustainability. More than 120 utilities have been recognized since the launch of the program in 2016
        
        Ideas In Future
        A bottle that can generate, pure water, gas, ice cubes that can be changed from a button
        A water bottle that can be compacted and the size of it can change.
        A car that could generate pure water from electricity.
        We can  install a mini water fountain inside a car or any electric vehicle that can generate water from a click of a button
        Also we can install solar panels on the roof of the car and try to make them basically invisible so they can’t be seen so it will look better as an aesthetic and look nicely pleasing to look at 
        Another idea that I have is to create computers for people so the systems will run better instead of getting prebuilt. Sometimes the prebuilts hardware isn’t produced efficiently, and the hardware isn’t good at all. Most of the time prebuilts don’t last as long as building a fresh new computer.

          Utilities are the basic services like your home, apartment, or business needs to keep it comfortable and functioning properly. Common utilities include water, sewer, electric, gas, trash, and recycling. Technology subscriptions like cable TV, internet, security, and phone service can also be considered utilities.
